Quick Dice Roller

##Description:4000##
Quick Dice Roller is an app made for the tabletop RPG Geek. It allow to emulate almost all the complex dice rolls required by RPG and board games.

The dice can be added at will, using common formulas as <i>2d6+5</i> as well as special functions like <i>rak(1d6,4,3)</i> that emulates the most complex game systems. An handy formulas builder simplifies the process, and allow to access to an online help.

Don't worry! You do not need to write the formula all the time! Once defined, a die can be rolled as many times as you want by simply touching the corresponding icon.

"Named values", as well as keep track of games scores, allow you to define formulas based on these scores. You can create, for example, the named value "Level" with label "lvl", then use the formula "(lvl)d6" to determine the fireball damage - that way you don't need to edit the formula each time your mage level up: just change the "Level" value!

Quick Dice Roller allow to create different dice bags (to organize dice by game system, by character or however you like) and it is possible to quickly switch between bags.

The app can be configured to chain link rolls, so two rolls made in rapid succession are linked together. Or, if such concatenation has to be made more than once, it is always possible to create a new die which sum the outcome of the two single rolls (i.e. <i>1d6+1d8</i>).

Like to play by chat or by e-mail? Quick Dice Roller allow to automatically copy last roll outcome to the clipboard, so sharing can be made with a simple <i>paste</i> command.

Quick Dice Roller is one of the few apps of it's category (maybe the only?) that allows to apply modifiers after a roll is made, as usual with a simple touch. The warrior was blinded? No problem: tap to roll for the attack and tap to apply a -4 modifier.
