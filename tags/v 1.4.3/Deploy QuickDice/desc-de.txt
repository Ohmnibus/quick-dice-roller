Quick Dice Roller

##Description:4000##
Quick Dice Roller is an extremely flexible and customizable dice roller designed around the needs of Role Playing Games fans.

Quick Dice Roller aims to be flexible, complete and handy at the same time.

With Quick Dice Roller it is possible to roll a die with a simple touch, scroll the last result list, link results and see the quality of a result at a glance (thanks to the star indicator).

The heart of Quick Dice Roller is a powerful expresson parser that allow to create virtually any combination of dice.
The parser can understand the four usual operators (+, -, *, /), brackets and the "d" operator that represent a die roll (ie 1d6).
Is therefore possible to represent complex rolls as "use a four sided dice as tens and a ten sided dice for as units" with the expression "(1d4*10) + (1d10-1)".
And when operators aren't enough you can use special functions to simulate main systems: roll&keep, open rolls, dice pool, etc.
The expression builder allow you to build any dice combination just selecting some menu items, even without any knowledge on expression syntax.
