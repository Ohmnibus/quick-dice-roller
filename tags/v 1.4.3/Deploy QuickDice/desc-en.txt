##Description:4000##
Quick Dice Roller is an app made for the tabletop RPG Geek. It make possible to emulate almost all the complex dice rolls required by those games.

The dice can be added at will, using common expressions as <i>2d6+5</i> as well as special functions like <i>rak(1d6,4,3)</i> that emulates the most complex game systems. An handy expression builder simplifies the process, and allow to access to an online help.

Quick Dice Roller allow to create different dice bags (to organize dice by game system, by character or however you like) and it is possible to quickly switch between bags.

Rolling dice with Quick Dice Roller is... well... quick. Rather than choosing a die type with a tap and rolling it with another tap, Quick Dice Roller allow to roll a die simply tapping on the corresponding icon. A saving of 50%!

The app can be configured to chain link rolls, so two rolls made in rapid succession are linked together. Or, if such concatenation has to be made more than once, it is always possible to create a new die which sum the outcome of the two single rolls (i.e. <i>1d6+1d8</i>).

Like to play by chat or by e-mail? Quick Dice Roller allow to automatically copy last roll outcome to the clipboard, so sharing can be made with a simple <i>paste</i> command.

Quick Dice Roller is one of the few apps of it's category (maybe the only?) that allows to apply modifiers after a roll is made, as usual with a simple touch. The warrior was blinded? No problem: tap to roll for the attack and tap to apply a -4 modifier.
