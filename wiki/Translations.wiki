#summary How to help to improve Quick Dice Roller by translating text

= Introduction =

Anyone, developer or not, can help to improve Quick Dice Roller by translating text or giving feed-back on current translations.

= Details =

As for all android apps, localized text is organized into XML resources with the following format:
{{{
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <string name="string_id_01">Text 01</string>
    <string name="string_id_02">Text 02</string>
<resources>
}}}
Text that need translation is the part included in the _string_ tag (`Text 01` and `Text 02` in the example).

Different languages are stored in different files all with the same name (`string.xml`) but located in different folders.
